\title{List edge contribution}
\usage{
edge_contribution(net, motif, type_attr = c("sesType"), level = -1)
}
\arguments{
\item{motif}{motif identifier}

\item{type_attr}{character vector specifying the attribute name where level
information is stored in statnet object. The attribute should be a binary
vector. 1 indicates a "social" node and 0 indicates a "non-social" node.}

\item{level}{level of the dyads which shall be considered, or -1 if the level
shall be determined automatically.}

\item{g}{statnet network object}
}
\value{
data frame with three columns, listing edges and their contribution
  to motifs described by the motif identifier in descending order
}
\description{
List gaps ordered by contribution to a motif. This is a list of ties together
with the number of motifs of a given class the dyad would generate by being
flipped. This is a gneralisation of ``identify_gaps`` and ``critical_dyads``.

edge_contribtion(ml_net, list('1,2[I.C]'))
