\usage{
plot_gaps_or_critical_dyads(
  net,
  edge_contribution,
  colour,
  title,
  lvl_attr = c("sesType"),
  cutoff = 2,
  subset_graph = "none",

)
}
\arguments{
\item{net}{Statnet network object}

\item{lvl_attr}{Node attribute specifiying level information}

\item{cutoff}{Cutoff point in contributions of an edge to the number of
motifs above which to analyse gaps}

\item{subset_graph}{Whether to subset the graph to only show nodes involved
in gaps. One of "none" (no subset, default), "partial" (only focal level is
subset) or "focal" (only focal level shown)}

\item{...}{list of additional parameters to be passed to plotting function
(see ?motifr::plot_mnet), eg. label = TRUE}

\item{motif}{Motif to explore gaps in for}

\item{level}{Focal level for gap analysis}
}
\value{
A plot of gaps, sized by weight in a multilevel network
}
\description{
Note that this only works for undirected graphs. Regardless of whether the
input graph is directed it is treated as undirected graph.
