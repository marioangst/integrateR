Description: This package provides tools for motif analysis in multi-level networks.
    Multi-level networks combine multiple networks in one, e.g. social-ecological networks. 
    Motifs are small configurations of nodes and edges (subgraphs) occurring in networks.
    motifr is visualizes multi-level networks, counts multi-level network motifs, compares them to a baseline.
    It also identifies contributions of potential edges to motifs to find critical or missing edges.
    The package is in many parts a R wrapper for the excellent SESMotifAnalyser Python package written by
    Tim Seppelt.
