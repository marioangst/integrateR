Description: This package provides tools to analyze and visualize integrated (multi-level) networks.
    Multi-level networks combine multiple networks in one, e.g. social-ecological networks.
    Integrated networks are specific networks combining causal loop diagrams (CLDs) and social networks.
    The package has three main areas: Visualization, Aggregation and Analysis.
    Visualization: The package visualizes CLDs and two-level networks.
    Aggregation: The package implements ways to aggregate CLDs to use as inputs in multi-level networks.
    Analysis: The package is in many parts a R wrapper for the excellent sesmotifanalyser Python package written by
    Tim Seppelt to count multi-level network motifs, compare them to a baseline and much more. 
    It further identifies and visualizes functional gaps in integrated networks and virtuous and vicious
    cycles in CLDs.
