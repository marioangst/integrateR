Description: This package provides tools for motif analysis
    in multi-level networks. Multi-level networks combine multiple
    networks in one, e.g. social-ecological networks. Motifs are small
    configurations of nodes and edges (subgraphs) occurring in networks.
    motifr is visualizes multi-level networks, counts multi-level network
    motifs, compares them to a baseline. It also identifies contributions
    of potential edges to motifs to find critical or missing edges.  The
    package is in many parts a R wrapper for the excellent
    'SESMotifAnalyser' Python package written by Tim Seppelt.
