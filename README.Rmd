This package provides tools to analyze multi-level networks in terms of _motifs_. 

Multi-level networks combine multiple networks in one representation, e.g. social-ecological networks, which connect a social network (eg. interactions among fishermen) with an ecological network (eg. interactions between fish species) and the ties inbetween (eg. fishers who fish specific species).

[Motifs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_motif) are small configurations of nodes and edges (subgraphs) within an overall network.

Package features include:

  - Visualization: The package provides functions to visualize multi-level networks, based on [ggraph](https://github.com/thomasp85/ggraph).
  
  - Motif counts: The package is in many parts a R wrapper for the excellent [sesmotifanalyser](https://gitlab.com/t.seppelt/sesmotifanalyser) Python framework written by Tim Seppelt to count multi-level network motifs, compare them to a baseline and much more. Only parts of of sesmotifanalyser are yet wrapped, so consult the python framework for additional functionality. 
  
- Contributions of edges to motifs: motifr further identifies and visualizes functional gaps and critical edges in multi-level networks based on contributions of existing or potential edges to given motifs (this is theoretically based on network theories of functional fit and misfit).


## Installation

The package is currently at an early stage of development. Explore at your own risk and please report any issues using the [issue tracker on github](https://github.com/marioangst/motifr/issues). You can install the package from github, using devtools:

```{r eval=FALSE}
devtools::install_github("marioangst/motifr")
```

## Input

motifr currently can only reliably handle undirected and unweighted networks. There is in principle no restriction on the number of levels of a network to count motifs in, but typical use cases for which the package was designed will likely involve two- or three-level networks.

Network data should currently be prepared as statnet network objects with a numeric vertex attribute to specify a level for each node (named eg. "lvl") for best results.

## Examples


```{r}
library(motifr)
```

### Visualize a multi-level network

The following network is an example network from an empirical analysis of wetlands management in Switzerland. It consists of two levels - one level specifies a network of relations between actors. A second level specifies a network of relations between different activities occurring in the wetland, based on causal interdependence among activites. Links between the levels specify which actors carry out which activities.

It is possible to specify layouts for every network level separately. Below, one level is plotted based on a circle layout, the second one based on Kamada-Kawai.

```{r}
plot_mnet(net = ml_net,
          lvl_attr = "sesType",
          layouts = list("kk","circle"))
```

### Count motifs

Motifs can be counted using the versatile function ``count_motifs()``. It takes as parameters a statnet network object (use ``ml_net`` or ``dummy_net`` provided by this package as example) and a list of motif identifiers (see below) specifying the motifs. See the [vignette on the motif zoo](https://marioangst.github.io/motifr/articles/motif_zoo.html) for details on nomenclature for motifs (motif identifier strings). Let's quickly check out two classic examples of three-node, two-level motifs (open and closed triangles) in the wetlands management network introduced above:

```{r  out.width="300px"}
show_motif(motif = '1,2[I.C]', net = ml_net, label = TRUE) # open ('1,2[I.C]') triangle
show_motif(motif = '1,2[II.C]', net = ml_net, label = TRUE) # closed ('1,2[II.C]') triangle
```


Let's count the number of of these motifs in the entire network.

```{r}
motifs = list('1,2[I.C]', '1,2[II.C]') # open and closed triangle

count_motifs(ml_net, motifs)
```

An exploratory approach can be taken by calling ``motif_summary()``. This function counts the occurrences of a couple of interesting motifs. Furthermore it computes expectations and variances for the occurrence of these motifs in a modified Erdős-Rényi model. See the package [vignette on random baselines](https://marioangst.github.io/motifr/articles/random_baselines.html) for details.

```{r}
motif_summary(ml_net)
```

### Identify gaps and critical edges

motifr makes it possible to identify gaps and critical edges in multi-level networks. This is motivated by theories of functional fit and misfit in networks, which posit that certain motifs are especially valuable for network outcomes (depending on the context). 

In relation to gaps, we can therefore try to identify potential edges that would create a large number of a given motif if they were to exist ("activated" or "flipped"). The number of such motifs created by an edge is their contribution. For example, we can get all edges that would create closed triangles ('1,2[II.C]'), including the information about how many such triangles they would create for the wetlands case study network:

```{r}
gaps <- identify_gaps(ml_net, motif = '1,2[II.C]')
head(gaps)
```

We can also plot these gaps in our network, including option to only look at gaps above a certain weight (contribution) and different levels of focus to only show nodes involved in such gaps. Here again for the wetlands management network, only showing gaps with a weight above 5.

```{r}
plot_gaps(ml_net, 
          "1,2[II.C]", 
          level = -1, 
          subset_graph = "partial", 
          cutoff = 5, label = TRUE)
```

``identify_gaps`` has a sibling in ``critical_dyads``. Critical_dyads works in reverse to identifying gaps - it analyzes for every existing edge how many instances of a given motif would disappear if the edge would be removed.

### Comparing motif occurrence to a random baseline

Motifr can be used to simulate a random baseline of networks. Motif counts in an empirical network can then be compared to the distribution of motif counts in the random networks. We do so again here for open and closed triangles in the wetland management network. Unsurprisingly, we find that both of these motifs occur much more often in the empirically observed network than in the random baseline. See the package [vignette on random baselines](vignettes/random_baselines.Rmd) for details.

```{r}
motifs = list('1,2[I.C]', '1,2[II.C]') # open ('1,2[I.C]') and closed ('1,2[II.C]') triangles

compare_to_baseline(ml_net, motifs = motifs, n = 100)
```
