The goal of integrater is to ...

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date.

## Installation

Not at this stage yet.

## Example

Recoding:

```{r example}
library(integrateR)
## basic example code
```


```{r}
animal_codebook <- data.frame(
  animal = c("elephant", "pig", "lizard"),
  family = c("mammal","mammal","reptile"))
vec <- sample(c("elephant", "pig", "lizard"), 50, TRUE)
vec
```


Let's recode this:

```{r}
rename_based_on_codebook(input = vec,
                         codebook = animal_codebook,
                         rawvar = "animal",
                         codevar = "family")
```
